## configure hdfs superuser group name

By defaultï¼Œonly the user who start the namenode process has the super group privilege (e.g. hdfs by default).
But in practice, many commands(e.g. fsck) requires the super user privilege. To faiclitate this kind of actions,
we can set up a superuser group. All users in this group will have the super user privilege. So be careful when you
add user into this group
```xml
<property>
    <name>dfs.permissions.superusergroup</name>
    <value>hdfs</value>
</property>
```
