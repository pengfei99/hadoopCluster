# Install hdfs clients

## For linux

For linux, follow the below steps

- Download jdk (11 for hadoop 3.3.6), set up JAVA_HOME in your env var
- Download the hadoop bin, set up HADOOP_HOME in your env var
- add $HADOOP_HOME/bin, $JAVA_HOME/bin into your `path`
- configure the `hadoop-env.sh` with the right java_home
- copy the dfs url from the server `core-site.xml` to your local `core-site.xml`, below is an example

```xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
    <value>hdfs://name-node-url:9000</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
```

Test your client

```shell
hdfs dfs -ls /
```

## For windows

For windows, you need to do all the steps of the linux client.

Then you need to download the winutils for hadoop. You can go to this [github page](https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils) to download the binary

If your path is set up correctlly, you should be able to run below command from a `cmd` windows

```shell
