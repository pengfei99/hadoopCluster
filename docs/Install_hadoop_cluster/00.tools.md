# Useful tools for managing the cluster

## 1. Rsync

Rsync is a flexible network and directory synchronization tool. Minimum bandwidth consumption due to the use of the 
algorithm to minimize the amount of copied data by moving the changed parts of the file and compressing the files 
at the source and destination while sending and receiving data.
It is faster than the SCP (Secure Copy) command, because by using the remote-update protocol,

```shell
# installation
sudo apt install rsync

# general syntax
rsync <options> <src> <user>@<host>:<dest>
# use rsync to sync conf files between servers
```

### 1.1 Some popular options:
1. (-a, --archive):	This option is used to activate archive mode, transfer specific devices, block devices, recursive 
synchronization of directories, and maintain groups, ownership, and symbolic links.
2. (-P, --partial --progress):	This option runs to view the progress bar while transferring files.
3. (-z, --compress):	This option is used to compress data when transferring to the destination device.
4. (-q, --quiet):	are executed to suppress non-error messages.
5. (--delete):	By running this option, the rsync command will delete additional files from the destination.
6. (-e): to select a different remote shell from the default remote shell rsync(ssh) is executed.
7. (-r): used to copy data recursively.
8. (-v, --verbose):	Provides visual output to view the progress of the process.
9. (-h, --human-readable): provides human-readable format.

### 1.2 Some examples

**The source and destination server must both have rsync installed**

```shell
# sync a local file to destination server
rsync -a ~/test1 username@remote_host:destination_directory

# sync remote file to local 
rsync -a username@remote_host:/home/username/test1 place_to_sync_on_local_machine

# rsync uses ssh to transfer data, if the ssh port is not 22, you need to specify it
# in below example, the destination server ssh port is on 2322
rsync -a -e "ssh -p 2322" test1 remote_user@remote_host_or_ip: destination_directory

## compress the data during sync
rsync -azvP
```

> test1 can be a file or directory, if it's a directory and contains the subdirectory, you need to add -r option

## 2.Write a xsync script to distribute conf file on workers

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# check arg numbers
if [ $# -lt 1 ]
then 
  echo Not enough Argument
  exit;
fi 

# 2. loop through host list
for host in spark-w01 spark-w02
do 
  echo =========================== $host ==============================
  
  # 3. loop through the give file list, sync it one by one
  for file in $@
  do
     # 4. check if the file exists
     if [ -e $file ]
         then
           # 5. get the parent dir
           pdir=$(cd -P $(dirname $file); pwd) 
           # 6. get the filename
           fname=$(basename $file)
           ssh $host "mkdir -p $pdir"
           rsync -av $pdir/$fname $host:$pdir
          else
            echo $file does not exists!
     fi 
  done
done 
```
